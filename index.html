      Implementation Of a System To Enhance The Quality Of Education In Rural
      Areas.
    </h1>
    <p>
      This project aims to develop a hybrid offlineâ€“online educational platform
      to improve the quality of education in rural areas. It will provide study
      materials, mentor access, and tools to monitor skill progress, focusing on
      both literacy and communication skills. The system will bridge the digital
      divide by offering affordable connectivity and devices to learners.
      Additionally, it will support research and development activities and give
      access to shared material resources, fostering overall community growth
      and self-reliance.
